				Training in neonatal point-of-care echocardiography (also known as “targeted” or “functional” echocardiography) is a complex process which requires not only comprehensive theoretical knowledge, but also extensive hands-on training to acquire the all-so-important technical skills. Due to restricted access to live subjects, particularly neonates, opportunities for practical training are limited.
			</p>
			<p>
				To overcome this obstacle, echocardiography simulators have been developed. Weidenbach et al  introduced 2D echocardiography simulation by use of real 3D image volumes which have been used both for transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography. In infants and younger children, simulators based on real 3D volumes have been used for training physicians with minimal echocardiography experience with good results. The knowledge of cardiac anatomy as depicted by echocardiography and detection of congenital heart defects is improved while spacial orientation and hand eye coordination is enhanced by use of the simulators. However, presently available transthoracic echocardiographic simulators based on real 3D volumes are restricted to 2D echocardiography lacking other modalities such as color flow Doppler, spectral Doppler and M-mode.  Furthermore, since image volumes are obtained either from subcostal or apical windows, simulation of echocardiography from parasternal and suprasternal windows may be suboptimal. In general, real transthoracic echocardiographic images obtained in older children and adults are of poor quality and not suitable for simulation. For these reasons, for transthoracic echocardiography, almost all commercially available simulators obtain their 3D images from other imaging platforms such as MRI and render them to look like echocardiograms. These simulators are used extensively in training of intensivists, emergency room physicians and anesthesiologists in addition to cardiology technologists in skills of performing echocardiograms.
			</p>

				Weidenbach et al have recently introduced a training simulator for echocardiography in neonates. Although this simulator includes extensive cases of congenital cardiac defects, functional and acquired heart diseases, it only simulates 2D echocardiography for anatomical diagnosis and has the above limitations. In spite of these limitations it is used by neonatologists for training purposes. We have developed a <span class="bold">Virtual Neonatal Echocardiographic Training Simulator (VNETS)</span> with exclusive emphasis on neonates and young infants. This system has the capability of simulating real-time scanning from all acoustic windows. It offers the capability of performing real time  two-dimensional (2D) echocardiography and color flow Doppler, spectral Doppler, and M-mode modalities from specific sector cuts.
